# walnutButter
We have a walnut tree in the backyard that never gets utilized, so I was thinking why not automate the collection and processing of it, first to not be wasteful and second to be more self sufficient
Functions:
  Gather nuts from the ground (Should)
  Husk the nuts(Should)
  Sort by size (Should)
  Store nuts in hopper like area to be cracked (Must)
  Crack nuts open enough to separate shell and meat (Must)
  Split up the walnut shell and walnut meat (hard because the septum is between the nut as well) (Must)
  Walnut meat is to be washed/boiled to reduce bitter taste (Must)
  Stored as is (Should)
  Made into walnut butter using online recipes (usually just bake the walnuts for a little bit then blend and salt it) (Should)
